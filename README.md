leap-java-draw
==============

This code sample is a very basic paint tool using the Leap Motion in Java. Controls:
- Draw using a finger (average position of multiple fingers)
- 'tap' screen gesture toggles between draw/erase

Requirements
----
Java 1.6 and Leap Motion

This is just a basic proof of concept, more to come soon.
